            <p>A lot of the work at Tadoba Resort club is done by the rural people of Tadoba and our most of the staff is from the same village, which is our contribution to rural public participation for development of area as well as responsible tourism.</p>

            <p>Now it comes to the most delicious part of our property i.e. food. Yes, we have our own unique great flavours which we are maintaining from the beginning. Our approach is simple. We have a passion for pure flavour, quality ingredients and for creating an atmosphere that is jovial, and a haven for people who simply love food. Hygiene and nutritional value is very well maintained. You will feel homely touch to our every dish.
            </p>
                
            <p>We provide both veg food (herbivore) and non–veg food (carnivore) which is according to our AP plan. We have buffet/ fixed menu. If you wish to have something of your choice, our chef would definitely prepare it, but on prior notice as we have to bring most of the things from the market which is 25 km away. Each of our dish is created to pamper you almost. Because we know that, “One cannot think well, love well and sleep well if one has not dined well." So, let’s rediscover and rejuvenate yourself in the wilderness to Tadoba with Royal Tiger Resort.
